# IgorPro_PlottingTools
Functions I use to make plots and more. See notes in file for information use. Examples to be uploaded.

Most of these functions were written in Igor Pro 8. They may not be compatible with previous versions of Igor Pro, so use at your own discretion.

## HKang_AvgMatchToTime.ipf

This function averages a wave with a corresponding time wave into a shorter time series.

Ex) Takes a measurement wave in 5 minute intervals and converts it into an hourly interval wave by averaging.

## HKang_DiurnalPlot.ipf

Takes time series data and makes a diurnal plot. see inside for details

## HKang_LinRegConfIntervals.ipf

Displays confidence and prediction intervals for a 2 dimensional linear regression. Please see the Igor Pro help file for additional details.

## HKang_MatchToHysplit.ipf

Matches a measurement time series to Hysplit cluster time series.

## HKang_MatchedTimeScatterPlot.ipf

Displays a scatterplot between 2 time series waves. Only displays the points where the times match between the 2 waves.

## HKang_GetMatchedTimes.ipf
