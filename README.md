# IgorPro_PlottingTools
Functions I use to make plots.

Most of these functions were written in Igor Pro 8. They may not be compatible with previous versions of Igor Pro, so use at your own discretion.

## HKang_AvgMatchToTime.ipf

This function averages a wave with a corresponding time wave into a shorter time series.

Ex) Takes a measurement wave in 5 minute intervals and converts it into an hourly interval wave by averaging.

## HKang_DiurnalPlot.ipf

Takes data and makes a diurnal plot.

## HKang_MatchedToHysplit.ipf

## HKang_MatchedTimeScatterPlot.ipf

Displays a scatterplot between 2 time series waves. Only displays the points where the times match between the 2 waves.

## HKang_GetMatchedTimes.ipf

Gets time waves to match.
